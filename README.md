 In this project I mastered:
 - Webpack (sass + handlebars + dev server boilerplate)
 - Handlebars variables and templates
 - GSAP

### Installation

You could follow next steps to deploy a local project:
 - clone branch `master` with `git clone https://github.com/WebNadin/info-block-animated/.git` or fork it and then clone it from your forked repo
 ```
npm install
```
The SASS/SCSS code goes inside the styles directory.

The JS code goes inside the app directory.

The Handlebars files goes inside the templates directory.

 - Start the _Webpack Dev Server_:
 ```
npm run dev
```

 - Go to the url:
`http://localhost:8080`

 - Start to code and see the magic happens.

 -  After you finish the development, run the next command to have all your code available and minified in your build directory:
 ```
npm run build
```
